1. SWSamp_binomial.R: the power analysis function adopted from Biao's codes.
2. sampcalc_pdt_oldvspdtold.R: codes to run the power analysis, run this file if you want to perform a power analysis.
3. powercurves.R: codes to generate the power curves.

If you want to perform a new power analysis, you need to modify the parameters in the ss_calc() function in the second R file (the main R file).
